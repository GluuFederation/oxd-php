# oxd-php
PHP Client Library for the [Gluu oxD](https://www.gluu.org/docs-oxd/).

**oxdphp** is a thin wrapper around the [communication protocol](https://www.gluu.org/docs-oxd/oxdserver/) of oxD server. This can be used to access the OpenID connect of the Gluu Server via the oxD RP. This library provides the function calls required by a website to access user information from a OpenID Connect Provider (OP) by using the OxD as the Relying Party (RP).
